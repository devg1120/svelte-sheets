# Virtual Scrolling

-   By default, both rows and columns are virtual scrolling without any settings, and it can support more than 200,000 data entries.
-   The fewer cells displayed, the better the performance.
-   Even though virtualized tables are efficient, when the data load is too large, network and memory capacity can become bottlenecks for the application.
