# e-virt-table  
> A canvas-based editable virtual table component. It can be used as a data grid, similar to Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, supporting virtual scrolling, cell editing, and other features.  

## Characteristics
1. Large data tables often experience interface lag during loading and operations due to the overwhelming data size, severely impacting user experience.  
2. In scenarios involving data validation during editing, conventional virtual tables cannot validate data or scroll to the error points.  
3. After data changes, users may only need to transmit the modified cell data instead of the entire dataset.  
4. Desired Excel-like functionalities, such as filling, copying, and keyboard events.
